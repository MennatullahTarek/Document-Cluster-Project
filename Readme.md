# Document Clustering Project

## Overview üìñ‚úçÔ∏è  
This project applies **unsupervised learning techniques** to cluster documents from two datasets:  
- **People Wikipedia Dataset**  
- **20 Newsgroups Dataset**  

The goal is to uncover inherent structures within these datasets, providing insights into the natural groupings of the documents.

## Datasets üìö  
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ 20 Newsgroups Dataset  
- **Description**: Contains ~20,000 newsgroup documents categorized into 20 different topics, covering politics, religion, sports, technology, and more.  
- **Source**: Available via `sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups()`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ People Wikipedia Dataset  
- **Description**: Consists of biographical texts from Wikipedia about various individuals.  
- **Source**: Extracted and preprocessed for clustering tasks.

## Approach & Methodology üõ†Ô∏è  
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing  
- Text cleaning (removal of stopwords, punctuation, and special characters)  
- Tokenization and vectorization (TF-IDF)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction  
- Using **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text into numerical representations.  
- Applied **BERT embeddings** for richer semantic representations of the text.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering Techniques  
- **K-Means Clustering**  
- Enhanced clustering with **UMAP** for dimensionality reduction and **scaling** to improve model performance.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation & Visualization  
- **Silhouette Score** for cluster evaluation  
- **Word Clouds & PCA plots** for visualization
