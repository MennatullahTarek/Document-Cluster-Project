# Document Clustering Project

## Overview üìñ‚úçÔ∏è  
This project applies **unsupervised learning techniques** to cluster documents from two datasets:  
- **People Wikipedia Dataset**  
- **20 Newsgroups Dataset**  

The goal is to uncover inherent structures within these datasets, providing insights into the natural groupings of the documents.

---

## Datasets üìö  
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ 20 Newsgroups Dataset  
- **Description**: Contains ~20,000 newsgroup documents categorized into 20 different topics, covering politics, religion, sports, technology, and more.  
- **Source**: Available via `sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups()`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ People Wikipedia Dataset  
- **Description**: Consists of biographical texts from Wikipedia about various individuals.  
- **Source**: Extracted and preprocessed for clustering tasks.

---

## Approach & Methodology üõ†Ô∏è  
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing  
- Text cleaning (removal of stopwords, punctuation, and special characters)  
- Tokenization and vectorization (TF-IDF)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction  
- Using **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text into numerical representations.  
- Applied **BERT embeddings** for richer semantic representations of the text.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering Techniques  
- **K-Means Clustering**  
- Enhanced clustering with **UMAP** for dimensionality reduction and **scaling** to improve model performance.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation & Visualization  
- **Silhouette Score** for cluster evaluation  
- **Word Clouds & PCA plots** for visualization

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Business Insights & Cluster Meaning  
Based on the clusters, the following insights were drawn:  
1. **Topic Segmentation**: The K-Means algorithm efficiently grouped documents into coherent topics, which could be leveraged for targeted content creation and marketing strategies.  
2. **Audience Segmentation**: By analyzing the Wikipedia dataset clusters, we can identify common traits or themes among biographies of individuals in similar fields (e.g., science, art, politics), which is useful for personalizing user recommendations.  
3. **Trend Identification**: Clustering the 20 Newsgroups dataset revealed emerging trends or hot topics in specific domains (e.g., technology or politics), which could inform strategic decisions for media and news organizations.  
4. **Document Summarization**: The clusters represent groups of documents with similar content, which can be used for summarization and content aggregation in research, customer support, or media monitoring.

## Results & Insights üìä  
- Successfully clustered documents into meaningful groups.  
- **TF-IDF + K-Means** provided interpretable topic clusters.  
- **BERT embeddings** enhanced clustering with more accurate semantic representations.  
- **UMAP** helped visualize clusters in lower dimensions.  
- **LDA** generated topic distributions that align with human-labeled categories.

---

## Improvements üöÄ  
- Experimenting with **Deep Learning (BERT embeddings)** for better representations.
